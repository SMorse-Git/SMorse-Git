## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Samuel Morse. I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. Along with my major, I am also actively pursuing minors in both mathematics and finance. With specific personal research within the evolving fields of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, I plan to develop generative Artificial Intelligence solutions for businesses who operate on a global scale. I am proficient in the programming languages C, C++, and Python, giving me extensive low-level development knowledge. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations in AI and Data Science.
